Does this SAME object appear in the second image up to a rigid translation, rotation, and scale of the ENTIRE object as a whole? Respond with {yes} or {no}. There may be extra shapes in Image 2 that are not part of the original object; as long as the object from Image 1 is present, the answer is yes even if there are other shapes present."
