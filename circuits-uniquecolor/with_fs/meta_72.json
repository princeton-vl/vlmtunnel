  "prompt": "Which component does the wire from port 4 on the breadboard, which is the gray rectangle with numbered ports, connect to? A wire is a series of connected, same colored lines that go from the center of a port, represented on the screen as a white circle, to another port. Each wire only connects two ports, one at either end. A wire will NEVER turn at the same spot that it intersects another wire, and wires do not change colors. Answer with the component label in curly braces, e.g {C3}.",
